Project investigating relationship between CKD and biological markers

<<<<<<< HEAD
The contents of this project include the R scripts, which perform the following tasks:

**Transformation of the data-set**

-\> artificial joining of the data-sets (pre-split) and loading

-\> investigating the number of NAs, replacing the numerical ones with median and dropping the categorical; including converting character type variables to numerical

**Exploratory analysis**

-\> building a correlation heat map

-\> investigating the relationship between correlated variables (distribution and frequency plots)

**Modelling**

-\> linear regression for all predictors

-\> linear regression for the most two correlated predictors

-\> K-nearest neighbors modelling

**Principal component analysis**

**Functions**

-\> functions that help in building the ROC and confusion matrix plots
